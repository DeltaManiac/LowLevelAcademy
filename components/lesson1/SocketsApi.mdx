Now we know how UDP datagrams and IP packets are constructed, but we
don't have to do this ourselves all the time. Instead, we can use
tools and functions provided by the operating system and the
standard library of our programming language. In Rust, these
functions are part of the [`std::net`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/net/index.html)
module.

We can use the [`UdpSocket::bind`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/net/struct.UdpSocket.html#method.bind)
function to construct _sockets_, which are virtual files that associate your program with a given port number.
All UDP datagrams incoming to this port will be redirected to your program by the operating system.

[`UdpSocket::send_to`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/net/struct.UdpSocket.html#method.send_to) can be used
to construct UDP datagrams from a given payload and send them over the network. We can wait for a response by using
the [`UdpSocket::recv_from`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/net/struct.UdpSocket.html#method.recv_from)
function, which returns an IP address and a port number of a sender along with the message payload. In the case of
the name server request, we can interpret the payload as an IP address. If we send a request for Alice’s address to
the name server, we should get it back in this response!

Let's give it a try:

<Playground id="udpApi" codeWrapperFn={wrapFullDemoCode}>
  <FullDemoVis />
</Playground>

When you run this code, you can find a list of all IP packets you send and receive on the right. You can browse the
contents of IP packet headers and UDP datagrams. You can also find contents of an original message represented in
hexadecimal format below the packet browser.

With everything we have learned, you should be ready for a final test. In this test, you need to send a message to
your friend Alice. You know that she uses the port number `1000`—but you don't know her IP address yet! Maybe the
name server can help?

Congratulations, you have finished this lesson!

In the next one, we will cover the topic of fragmentation. So far we have been dealing with small messages only,
but what if you want to send a larger file, like a photo to share with your friend? We will learn how to break
large messages into small parts and how to reconstruct original files in the next lesson.
